- Add, Edit/Update are straightforward forms that allow users the use the features with ease.


## 5. Example of Reusable React Components: Notification Component
###  5.1 Purpose
The Notification component serves as a visual cue for notifying users about certain events, such as successful actions or errors. It was created to enhance user feedback and improve the overall user experience by providing immediate and contextually relevant information.

###  5.2 Usage
The Notification component is integrated across the application to display messages related to actions performed by users. These messages include, but are not limited to, post creation, update success and delete notifications.

###  5.3 Implementation
The component is built using React functional components and leverages context management to communicate and display notifications throughout the application. By using context, the Notification component can be easily consumed by other components without needing to pass down notification messages as props.

## 5.4 Example of how the Notification component is consumed
```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useNotification } from "../context/NotificationContext";
import classes from "./notification.module.css";

const Notification = () => {
  const { notification } = useNotification();

  return (
    <div>
      {notification && <p className={classes["notification"]}>{notification}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Notification;
```

## 5.4 Styling
The Notification component's appearance is controlled through CSS modules. This allows for encapsulated and scoped styling to prevent any unintended effects on other parts of the application. The CSS module defines the appearance of the notification container and the message text. The styling can be easily adjusted to match the application's design preferences.

## 5.4 Example of the CSS module (notification.module.css):
```css
/* notification.module.css */

.notification {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 20px;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: 1000;
}
```

## 7. Testing
### 7.1 API Endpoints Testing
- I verify that all API endpoints are working correctly and returning the expected responses.
- Each endpoint was tested with different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure proper functionality.

### 7.2 Data Integrity Testing
I verify the integrity of data stored in the database by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through the API.
I checked that data is saved correctly, updated accurately, and deleted successfully.
I checked that data retrieval is returned for different scenarios.

### 7.3 Lighthouse report
- Home page. [Result](https://github.com/David-Angel-M/docum-pp5/blob/main/01_Test.JPG)

### 7.4 WAVE Webaim Accessibility testing
The WAVE tool was used to test all pages on the app. Due to empty social links some common errors were found repeatedly over each tested page, those were:

- Home page WAVE [Result](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://secret-front-0474d6a815cf.herokuapp.com/)
- Login page WAVE [Result](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://secret-front-0474d6a815cf.herokuapp.com/login)

Desktop Testing:
I thoroughly tested all aspects of the site on Chrome and Safari browser, and I am pleased to report that everything functions flawlessly. Pages load swiftly, and all features, including CRUD operations, user authentication (login/logout), register process, post addition work without any issues.

Mobile Testing:
I conducted a thorough testing on three different mobile devices: Apple iPhone 11, Samsung S20FE, and Samsung S7 tablet. The website showcased excellent responsiveness and adaptability across various devices. The site performed seamlessly on Apple's Safari browser as well.

## 8. Deployment
The site was deployed using Heroku, by following the steps found in the tutorials and guidelines of CodeInstituteâ€™s material:

- Using my Heroku account
- Create a new app whilst logged in
- Connect my GitHub repository via "Connect to GitHub" option in Heroku
- Enable either "Automatic Deploy"
